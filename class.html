        During a one-day nude model drawing session at RISD, I discovered an unexpected foundation for my approach to graphic design. Observing and capturing the human form in real time challenged me to see beyond surface details—to focus on composition, negative space, and the rhythm of lines. This experience taught me the importance of structure, balance, and intentional mark-making, principles that directly translate into my design work. Through each sketch, I developed a deeper understanding of how visual elements interact, a skill that continues to shape my approach to typography, layout, and branding. What began as a figure-drawing exercise became a pivotal moment in my growth as a designer, reinforcing that at the core of all visual communication lies the art of seeing.
